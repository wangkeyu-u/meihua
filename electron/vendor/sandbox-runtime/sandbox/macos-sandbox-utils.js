/**
 * Generate filesystem read rules for sandbox profile
 *
 * Supports two layers:
 * 1. denyOnly: deny reads from these paths (broad regions like /Users)
 * 2. allowWithinDeny: re-allow reads within denied regions (like CWD)
 *    allowWithinDeny takes precedence over denyOnly.
 *
 * In Seatbelt profiles, later rules take precedence, so we emit:
 *   (allow file-read*)        ← default: allow everything
 *   (deny file-read* ...)     ← deny everything in denyOnly
 *   (allow file-read* ...)    ← re-allow allowWithinDeny
 *   (deny file-read* ...)     ← re-emit the denies the allows would clobber:
 *                               literal denies nested in an allow, and every
 *                               glob deny minus the allows it covers
 *                               (see lateReadDenyFilters)
 *   (allow file-read* (literal "/"))  ← only if a deny covers "/" itself
 *
 * REVIEW INVARIANT: after the allowWithinDeny block, this function only
 * ever adds denies (or narrows one with require-not). The one exception is
 * the pre-existing literal-"/" re-allow, which matches exactly one vnode.
 * Do not append another `(allow file-read* …)` layer here — every deny
 * above it would then need re-auditing for re-open bypasses.
